# QR Code Component

This project is a simple QR Code Component built using HTML and CSS. It is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring it looks great on both small and large screens.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.
- **Hover Effects**: The card scales and casts a shadow on hover for a polished user experience.
- **Clean Layout**: A centered design that prioritizes simplicity and usability.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure.
- **CSS3** for styling and responsiveness.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Place the project files in your preferred working directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to view the component.

## File Structure

```
project-folder/
|-- images/
|   |-- image-qr-code.png
|   |-- favicon-32x32.png
|-- index.html
```

### Files Explained

- **index.html**: Contains the markup for the QR Code Component.
- **images/**: Includes the QR code image and favicon.

## Customization

1. **Change the QR Code Image**:
   - Replace `image-qr-code.png` in the `images` folder with your own QR code image.
   - Ensure the file name matches the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag.

2. **Modify Text**:
   - Update the `<h1>` and `<p>` elements in `index.html` to change the title and description.

3. **Style Adjustments**:
   - Edit the `<style>` section in the `index.html` file to modify colors, fonts, or layout as needed.

## Responsive Design

The component follows a mobile-first design approach. The base styles are optimized for smaller screens, with media queries to enhance the layout for larger displays.

### Media Query Example

```css
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .card {
    max-width: 300px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    margin-top: 20px;
  }
  .card h1 {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
  .card p {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
  .card img {
    width: 90%;
  }
}
```
